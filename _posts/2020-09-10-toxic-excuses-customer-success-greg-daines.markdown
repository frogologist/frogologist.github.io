I happened upon a [CS100 Summit](https://cs100.clientsuccess.com/) presentation by Greg Daines about the common challenges faced by customer success teams. Greg's premise of 'toxic excuses' is too click-bait for my taste, but the case studies resonated with my experiences on the vendor side of software implementations.

This post outlines the key points in Greg's talk, posted by [ClientSuccess](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyebb34-V4tmrlJQlt40CZg) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQgJzm-5DPk) (24 minutes).

## Focus on the customer's business outcomes

People lose sight of the bigger picture because it's easier to obsess about technical detail.

Focus on delivering business results ([4:54](https://youtu.be/OQgJzm-5DPk?t=294)) and help customers improve their processes ([3:18](https://youtu.be/OQgJzm-5DPk?t=198)) instead of bending the product or hijacking the product roadmap to fit the status quo.

Prioritize issues by business impact. The laundry list of problems may shrink to a more manageable size, as in Greg's story about Paychex ([6:06](https://youtu.be/OQgJzm-5DPk?t=366)).

## Be clear about your value proposition

Provide the sales team with a clear bullseye ([10:11](https://youtu.be/OQgJzm-5DPk?t=611)). Focus on benefits rather than features and articulate the value proposition with precision ([13:06](https://youtu.be/OQgJzm-5DPk?t=786)).

## Deliver results, not happiness
Consider focusing on customer results rather than happiness ([18:00](https://youtu.be/OQgJzm-5DPk?t=1080) because the most engaged customers are more likely to test the boundaries of the product and identify potential flaws.

Eliminate low-yield activities and standardize the tactics that work ([20:13](https://youtu.be/OQgJzm-5DPk?t=1213)).
