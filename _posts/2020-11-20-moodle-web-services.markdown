The Moodle and Totara e-learning platforms include libraries of web service functions to integrate with other systems.

Totara Learn started as a [custom distribution of Moodle](https://totara.org/artefact/artefact.php?artefact=895&view=184&block=863) for enterprise use, so its web service API includes many Moodle functions.

The built-in documentation for both platforms occasionally lacks crucial information such as:
- The role capabilities required to use the function.
- Whether the function applies only to the Moodle mobile app.
- Guidance about use cases.

You can learn more about the gaps I encountered by reading my series of knowledge base articles.
