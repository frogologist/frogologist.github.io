## The author

Hello! My name is Kathryn. 

How did a neuroscientist end up in marketing? That's a bloody good question!

When I'm not writing about tech at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/), you'll find me out walking with my dog, camera, or both. You can follow my adventures on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathryn-marks/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wordycauses), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/frogologist).

## The blog

This blog is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site with the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme, hosted by [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). The content is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and stored in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/frogologist/frogologist.github.io).

Previous homes for this blog have included Content Management Systems (CMS) such as Blogger by [Pyra Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyra_Labs)/[Google](https://www.blogger.com), [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com), and a self-hosted [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) instance.

The irony of a database-driven CMS is that the content takes a back seat to the platform itself. Clumsy text editors are par for the course.

Jekyll, GitHub, and Markdown allow me to focus on writing.
