Moodle and Totara Learn support a range of languages in the form of language packs. Language packs are editable, so you may customize the wording and terminology to reflect your organization's culture. The Learning Management System (LMS) will feel more familiar to your learners and other users.

Modifying the language pack is intimidating the first time you try it. Finding the correct language string id is overwhelming, as there are so many, and it's difficult to tell one from another.

Fortunately, both platforms offer an admin utility that removes the guesswork. People often dive into editing language packs without knowing the utility exists.

You can learn more about the utility in my knowledge base article about customizing language strings.
