This article concerns versions 11-13 of Corel Draw. 

In these versions you can modify the default zoom behaviour such that `100%` reveals the document at full size.

This setting is accessed via `Tools` > `Options` > `Workspace` > `Toolbox` > `Zoom, Hand Tool` > `Zoom Relative to 1:1`.

You may also want to `Calibrate Rulers` from the same settings window.
