The PC game [Spore](http://www.spore.com/pc) failed to start on Mac OS X (Cheetah). 

The solution in a sentence: uninstall, reinstall, then load the game and enter authentication details before downloading and installing patches.

This summarizes a lengthy [forum thread](http://forums.electronicarts.co.uk/spore-technical-support/810040-spore-fails-start-mac-os-x-10-6-a.html). The forum post is no longer available, but I've included the link for posterity.
