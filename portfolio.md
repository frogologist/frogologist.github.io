## Writing samples

This site is mostly populated with older work (2010-2020).

I wrote most of my [blog posts]({% link index.md %}) and [knowledge base](https://frogologist.github.io/kb) (kb) articles during my time as a business analyst and product owner at Kineo. The kb was originally a personal site in the company's SharePoint instance; I've omitted proprietary information to protect Kineo's interests.

### Professional blog posts

I wrote four blog posts while working as a Product Marketing Manager at Octopus Deploy:

- [Octopus 2021 Q1: Self-host Octopus on Linux](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-release-2021-q1)
- [Octopus 2021 Q2: Migrate to the cloud with Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-release-2021-q2)
- [Octopus 2021 Q3: Google Cloud support with centralized Kubernetes deployments and runbooks](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-release-2021-q3)
- [Octopus 2021 Q4: Deploy to ECS with our guided UI step](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-release-2021-q4)

Note: The Q3 title was provided by my team. I would have preferred a shorter title containing a verb. :)

### Release highlights and breaking changes

Octopus Deploy's release notes are generated from GitHub via a bot. Product Marketing is responsible for writing the release highlights and compiling the breaking changes.

My technical background meant that I could write the breaking changes without direct input from product managers or developers. I relied on the GitHub issues and corresponding PRs document them for our readers. The engineers usually endorsed my copy without making changes.

- [Octopus 2021.1](https://octopus.com/downloads/whatsnew/2021.1)

## GitHub profiles

I have a couple of personal GitHub accounts:

- [frogologist](https://github.com/frogologist) contains this website

My main contributions are to the Octopus Deploy [blog](https://octopus.com/blog), but I also make updates to the [website](https://octopus.com), [product documentation](https://octopus.com/docs), and the [product roadmap](https://octopus.com/company/roadmap)

  - 2021.3
  - 2021.2
  - 2021.1
  - 2020.6

## Social media

I'm responsible for all posts, comments, and replies shared via Octopus Deploy's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OctopusDeploy) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/octopus-deploy/) profiles.

I transferred from Product Marketing to social media marketing in December 2021, becoming the first person to work full-time on social media at Octopus. Social became a side gig of mine in March or April 2021, a month or two after I joined the company.

I've been running Octopus Deploy's Twitter account since March 2021 and LinkedIn since December 2021. The Octopus launch posts from 2021 are mine, mixed in with content from others.
