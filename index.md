Hello!

Can you hear that? That’s the wind whistling through an empty website.

Please wander over to [stemandleaf.com.au](https://stemandleaf.com.au/), the new home for my portfolio and blog. I’ve moved the content across.

## Why am I keeping frogologist.github.io alive?

By keeping the site up, I can point people to it as evidence of my technical capabilities:

- _frogologist_ demonstrates my experience implementing a static site hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and stored in a code repository.
- Deploying a website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) meant using a little bit of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [YAML](https://yaml.org/). I quickly learned the perils of YAML indentation: use spaces instead of tabs, or your code won’t work!
- Using Jekyll meant I could keep writing in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I love the tidy HTML produced by Markdown compared to the mess you get with CMS text editors. You can see more of my writing in Markdown via my other GitHub profile, [kathrynmarks](https://github.com/kathrynmarks).

I unpublished the posts and articles to ensure search engines identify kathrynmarks.com as the source of truth. However, they’re still in the [repository](https://github.com/frogologist/frogologist.github.io), so you can see the site’s history.

## Why didn’t I redirect traffic to the new site?

I considered adding redirects to stemandleaf.com.au, but I don’t think my GitHub Pages site has any traffic.

## Why did I move away from a static site generator?

GitHub Pages is fun, but it [distracted me from writing](https://stemandleaf.com.au/blog/squarespace-review).
